Bambam is a simple baby keyboard (and gamepad) masher application that locks the keyboard and mouse and instead displays bright colors, pictures, and sounds.  While OSX has great programs like [AlphaBaby](http://www.kldickey.addr.com/alphababy/), the original author couldn't find anything for Linux and having wanted to learn Python for a while, Bambam was his excuse.
