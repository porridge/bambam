bambam (1.1.2+dfsg-1) sid; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, which however only contains two types of changes,
    which are targeted specifically at bullseye:
   - translation updates
   - a workaround for lack of proper keyboard grabbing under Wayland which
     has the potential of causing data loss (as a child using the game could
     relatively easily close the application)
